Write a program that:

Reads in lines from the keyboard, replaces any integers in each line with their English word equivalents, and displays the result. For example, if the input is

Today is November 11, 2011.

then the output should be

Today is November eleven, two thousand eleven.

The program is to read in text from the keyboard. It then prints out the same text, except that it turns every integer number between 0 and 9999, inclusive, into words. For the purposes of this program, an "integer" is any sequence of one or more digits.
